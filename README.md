# wifi_extender
This project demonstrates a WiFi extender with automatic hotspot reconfiguration using an ESP8266 and an I2C LCD display. The device scans for two pre-configured WiFi networks, connects to the first available network, and dynamically adjusts its SoftAP (hotspot) to reflect the active connection.
